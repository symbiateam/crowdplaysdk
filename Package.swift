// swift-tools-version: 5.10
// CrowdPlaySDK: CrowdPlay's capture SDK for iOS.
//
// The engine ships as a compiled binary (CrowdPlaySDKCore.xcframework,
// attached to this repo's releases); this manifest wraps it so
// `import CrowdPlaySDK` is the entire integration. LiveKit and
// swift-atomics are open-source dependencies fetched from their own
// repositories; the pins are exact because the capture engine is verified
// against these versions.
